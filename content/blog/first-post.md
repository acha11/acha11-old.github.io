I'm using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator to generate this site. After settling on github pages as a host, I tried Jekyll (since github has some native support for Jekyll build processes), but getting the necessary bits for Jekyll set up locally was a pain, so I switched to Hugo, building locally.

Not sure how much I'll blog this time around - let's see how this goes.
